                    (organizations with 50 or more employees) must write down their accessibility

                    Although this is a legal requirement for large organizations, organizations of
                    all sizes can benefit from documenting their policies as a way of ensuring
                    employees know the expectations going forward, or know where to look for a
                    reminder.
