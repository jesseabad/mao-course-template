    <h1>Offer Assistance</h1>
    <p>If you notice that a customer is having difficulty accessing your services,
        what would you do?</p>
    <p>
        Offer assistance and a smile.</p>
    <p>Your customer will appreciate the effort, even if
        they say “No, thank-you.”</p>
    <p>
        Great customer service begins with the question: “How can I help?”</p>
    <p><a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="access-offer">Access offers</a> are proactive ways to let people know that
        your goods and
        services are accessible to everyone.</p>

            for reception areas that asks visitors: “How can I help?” In documents, the offer may look a little
            different, such as: “Alternative formats are available on request.” Be sure to add contact information so
