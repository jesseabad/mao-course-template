            <p>Narrator: Accessibility is good for everyone.
                <p>Joanna Hawkins: Accessibility for me means accommodating any individual’s
                    needs. I know most people determine “access” and think of it as physical access,
                    so access for people that use wheelchairs or mobility devices. But they often
                    times don’t think about communications access for people with hearing loss, or people
                    who are deaf.
