                <p>One of the best ways to continue your learning is to discuss what you have learned about
                    accessibility with your colleagues.</p>

                <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
                <p>Ren has multiple disabilities. The person providing customer service assumes that Ren cannot
                    communicate or make decisions herself. The service provider only speaks to Ren’s support person,
                    instead of Ren.
                    <p>What is the barrier?</p>
                    <p>How can the service provider provide better customer service?
