	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Accessibility</strong> – Related to The Accessibility for Manitobans Act,
				accessibility means giving people of all abilities opportunities to participate fully in everyday life.
				Accessibility refers to the ability to access and benefit from a system, service, product or
				environment.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Access Offer</strong> – This is a proactive way for people to know that your goods
				and services are accessible to everyone. For example, in the resource section of accessibilitymb.ca, you
				will find signage for reception areas that asks visitors: “How can I help?” In documents, the offer may
				look a little different, such as: “Alternative formats are available on request.” Be sure to add contact
				information so people know where to make the request.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">The Accessibility for Manitobans Act (AMA)</strong> – The AMA is provincial
				legislation that was introduced to identify, remove and prevent barriers to accessibility. The AMA calls
				for accessibility standards that act as regulations. The law will result in improved accessibility for
				all Manitobans, regardless of their abilities.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong tabindex="0">Accessible (or Alternate) Format</strong> – This is a format of information that
			facilitates effective communication by or with a person who is disabled by a barrier. Examples of accessible
			or alternate formats include:
			<ul>
				<li>large print</li>
				<li>recorded audio</li>
				<li>electronic formats</li>
				<li>braille</li><br>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Accommodations (Reasonable Accommodations)</strong> – Accommodations are
				arrangements made to allow people with disabilities to participate or benefit equally. The Human Rights
				Code (Manitoba) requires that reasonable accommodations be made for people with disabilities up to the
				point of undue hardship. There is no set formula for what kind of modifications are necessary. Usually,
				this means a simple and inexpensive adjustment to how things are typically done. Examples include
				healthy snacks to accommodate dietary needs, or a flexible work schedule to accommodate Home Care or
				medication.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Barriers</strong> – Barriers are obstacles that limit access and prevent people with
				disabilities from fully participating in everyday life. Most barriers are not intentional. Barriers
				usually arise because spaces, goods or services do not take into account users’ diversity of abilities.
				For instance, this might be related to height, strength, memory or understanding. For more information
				on different types of barriers, please visit <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.accessibilitymb.ca/types-of-barriers.html">accessibility barriers.</a></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong tabindex="0">Disability (People with Disabilities)</strong> – A disability is a condition that
			limits a person’s daily activities. People with disabilities may have long-term physical, mental,
			intellectual or sensory impairments, which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their
			participation on an equal basis with others. A disability, aging, an injury and other life events may
			temporarily or permanently affect:
			<ul>
				<li>mobility</li>
				<li>dexterity (use of hands)</li>
				<li>vision</li>
				<li>hearing</li>
				<li>communication</li>
				<li>understanding</li>
				<li>mental health</li><br>
			</ul>

		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Large Employer</strong> – A large employer is one that employs at least 50 people.
				This includes seasonal employers who employ at least 50 people to do work that is expected to continue
				for at least 90 days.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong tabindex="0">Private Sector</strong> – The private sector includes businesses and organizations,
			such as:
			<ul>
				<li>stores and shops</li>
				<li>restaurants</li>
				<li> hotels</li>
				<li>bars</li>
				<li>conference centres</li>
				<li>charities</li>
				<li>places of worship</li>
				<li>non-profit organizations</li>
			</ul><br>
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong tabindex="0">Public Sector</strong> – The public sector includes organizations connected to the
			government, including:
			<ul>
				<li>Crown corporations</li>
				<li>regional health authorities</li>
				<li> school divisions</li>
				<li> post-secondary institutions</li>
				<li> municipalities</li>
				<li> government agencies, boards and commissions</li><br>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Service Animal</strong> – Defined by The Human Rights Code (Manitoba), a service
				animal is trained to assist a person with a disability. The work or tasks a service animal performs must
				be directly related to a person’s physical or mental disability. Animals that provide comfort and
				companionship, but are not trained to assist with a person’s disability, are not service animals. For
				more information on <a
					href=" http://www.manitobahumanrights.ca/v1/education-resources/resources/fact-sheet-pages/fact-sheet-service-animals.html"
					target="_blank">service animals</a>, please visit the Manitoba Human Rights Commission.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Sign Language Interpreter</strong> – A sign language interpreter is a person who
				translates from English to American Sign Language, using gestures and physical expressions (sign
				language). Interpreter services are critical to ensure accurate communication between individuals who
				are Deaf and hearing people who do not use sign language.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong tabindex="0">Support Person</strong> – In relation to a person who is disabled by a barrier, a
			support person is someone who accompanies that person to:
			<ul>
				<li>support the person obtaining, using or benefiting from a good or service provided by an organization
				</li>
				<li>assist the person in addressing his or her communication, mobility, personal care or medical needs
				</li>
			</ul><br>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong tabindex="0">Undue Hardship</strong> – Sometimes, an accommodation becomes so difficult it
				becomes unreasonable, or an undue hardship. However, it is more than minimal hardship and it must be
				based on actual evidence of hardship and not merely assumptions about how hard it would be to
				accommodate a person’s special needs. For more information on <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.manitobahumanrights.ca/v1/education-resources/resources/reasonable-accommodation.html ">undue
					hardship</a>, please visit the Manitoba
				Human Rights Commission.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p><strong>Universal Design</strong> – Universal design refers to making things safer, easier and more
				convenient for everyone. It involves a broad range of design concepts – including design of products,
				spaces and environments – to provide access in a way that respects all abilities.</p>
		</li>
