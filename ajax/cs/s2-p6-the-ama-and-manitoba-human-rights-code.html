    <h1>The Manitoba Human Rights Code and The AMA</h1>
    <p>The Accessibility for Manitobans Act (AMA) complements the Manitoba Human
        Rights Code and offers proactive ways to ensure accessibility for everyone,
        regardless of their abilities.</p>

    <h2>Reasonable Accommodation
    </h2>
    <p>
        Providing
        <a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="accommodations-reasonable-accommodations">reasonable accommodation</a>
        is a legal requirement and failure to reasonably accommodate an individual can
        result in “discrimination,” as defined in the Manitoba Human Rights Code.</p>
    <p>Simply put, reasonable accommodation means adjusting a rule, policy, practice
        or a physical space to allow changes to the ways things are usually done.</p>
    <h2>Duty to Accommodate</h2>
    <p>In most cases, providing reasonable accommodation in customer service is
        simple and affordable. Reasonable accommodation requires a business or
        organization to take responsibility for an accommodation – including bearing the
        costs – up to the point of
        <a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="undue-hardship">undue hardship</a>. Undue
        hardship arises from substantial costs or health and safety risks to an
        accommodation. Inconvenience, preferences, or having to bear some costs do not
        usually qualify as undue hardship. Although undue hardship is not defined in the
        AMA or the Manitoba Human Rights Code, case law tells us that it is more than
        minimal hardship and it must be based on actual evidence of hardship.</p>
    <p>If an accommodation request creates undue hardship for you and/or your
        organization, you and/or your organization still need to explore other ways to
        provide accessible customer service. Collaborate with the person making the
        request to find another way to provide customer service. With flexibility,
        openness, and good communication, accommodation solutions are usually possible,
        easy and inexpensive.</p>

        <li class="dfn-accommodations-reasonable-accommodations">Accommodations are arrangements made to
            allow people with disabilities to participate or benefit equally. The Human
            Rights Code (Manitoba) requires that reasonable accommodations be made for
            people with disabilities up to the point of undue hardship. There is no set
            formula for what kind of modifications are necessary. Usually, this means a
            simple and inexpensive adjustment to how things are typically done. Examples
            include healthy snacks to accommodate dietary needs, or a flexible work schedule
            to accommodate Home Care or medication.</li>
        <li class="dfn-undue-hardship">Sometimes, an accommodation becomes so difficult
            it becomes unreasonable, or an undue hardship. However, it is more than minimal
            hardship and it must be based on actual evidence of hardship and not merely
            assumptions about how hard it would be to accommodate a person’s special needs.
