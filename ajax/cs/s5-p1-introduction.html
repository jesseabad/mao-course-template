    <h1>Continuing Your Learning: Introduction </h1>
    <p>This is the final section of the module. We hope that you can put into practice what you have learned about
        Manitoba’s accessibility law by meeting the requirements, and by implementing the tips to remove barriers.</p>
    <p>Learning about accessibility is not a one time or static exercise. As you learned in Section two, The
        Accessibility Standard for Customer Service is one of five standards that will be implemented throughout
        Manitoba’s public and private sectors in the years to come.</p>
