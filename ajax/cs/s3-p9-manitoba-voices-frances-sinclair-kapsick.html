                Narrator: Accessibility is good for everyone.</p>
            <p>
                Frances Sinclair-Kaspick: Accessibility means to me, a variety of different
                things for different types of disability. For me, my disability is physical and
                also, I have walking mobility concerns. And those concerns are, when I enter
                buildings or even when I go outside and one other big concern is winter, for me.</p>
