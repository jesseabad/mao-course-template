    <p class="">Requirement two states that organizations and their employees must accommodate assistive devices used by
        their customers.</p>
    <h2 class="clear-both">What is an assistive device? </h2>
    <p>Assistive devices, like canes or hearing aids, help people with disabilities complete everyday tasks and create
        access to goods and services. When a person who is blind or hard of hearing uses a cell phone to communicate,
        especially during an appointment, the phone becomes an assistive device.</p>
    <h2>What can you do to meet this requirement? </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Avoid moving assistive devices out of a customer’s reach.</li>
        <li>Ask for permission before touching assistive devices, if necessary.</li>
        <li>Let customers know if you offer any assistive devices. For example, some organizations offer wheelchairs.
            Others have accessibility features at a self-serve checkout. </li>
        <li>Become familiar with any assistive devices available for customers and be prepared to use or explain them,
            as required by Requirement 8, Accessibility Training.</li>
    </ol>
