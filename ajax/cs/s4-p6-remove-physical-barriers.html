    <h1>Remove Physical Barriers</h1>

                <p>Physical barriers affect many more people than wheelchair users. Many customers and clients with
                    invisible or visible disabilities will benefit when your space is well organized with clear signage
                    and lots of room to move around.</p>
                <h2>Four Tips to Get You Started</h2>
                <p><strong>Tip 1: </strong>If you are asked to help push someone using a wheelchair, do not leave the
                    person in an awkward place, facing a wall, in crowded corridors, or in the path of opening doors.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Tip 2: </strong>Maintain indoor and outdoor surfaces, including ramps, to help prevent falls.
                    Do not block ramps with rolling garbage bins, and make sure all surfaces are clean and free of snow.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Tip 3: </strong>Even if there are steps into your building, you can still provide accessible
                    service by offering customers home delivery, curbside pickup, a temporary/removable ramp, or meeting
                    in an easy access location.</p>
                <p><strong>Tip 4: </strong>Reflective glass and protective barriers that separate service providers from
                    customers can cause customers to walk into hard surfaces, such as glass doors and signage, or to be
                    confused about the source of sound or speech.</p>
