                <p>Requirement eight states that organizations must ensure employees complete
                    accessibility training as soon as possible and when there have been updates to
                    the organization’s accessibility measures, policies or practices.</p>
                <p>
                    Training must address the requirements of the Accessibility Standard for
                    Customer Service, as included in this online learning program, a review of The
                    Accessibility for Manitobans Act and the Manitoba Human Rights Code, and related
                    organizational policies and practices.
                </p>
                <p>Employees must also be trained on how to use assistive devices that are
                    available for customer use.
                </p>
                <h2 class="clear-both">What can you do to meet this requirement?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Require all employees, including owners, managers, and frontline staff to take customer service
                        training, such as this online module. As a group, discuss how the training relates to the
                        customer service practices of your organization. For help getting the discussion started, see
                        the Accessible Customer Service Facilitator’s Guide

                            aria-label="Download Accessible Customer Service Facilitator’s Guide PDF">(PDF)</a>
                        <a target="_blank" href="./resources/CS_FacilitatorsGuide_En.docx" link="rel"
                            aria-label="Download Accessible Customer Service Facilitator’s Guide Word document">(Word)</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Encourage questions and feedback. Create a safe and inviting environment to share concerns about
                        accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>Centre the perspectives and advice of people with disabilities in your training. Personal
                        stories that relate to accessibility in a person’s own life can be valuable. Remember, nearly
                        one in four Manitobans has a disability, and others will age into disability, so everyone is
                        affected.</li>
                    <li>If you have assistive devices or other accessibility features available for customers, ensure
                        that your employees are familiar with using them and explaining how to use the tools. For
                        example, providing customers with clear and simple instructions on how to access the settings on
                        a computer, or a mobility device.</li>
                    <li>Have a plan to train new staff and volunteers about customer service. Include this online
                        learning module as a part of your training plan for staff and volunteers. Organizations with
                        over 50 staff must write down their training plan.</li>
