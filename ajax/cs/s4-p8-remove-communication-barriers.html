                <p>Clear communication is essential for great customer service.
                </p>
                <p>It is especially important to know how to remove barriers to communication so
                    that everyone can participate fully in everyday life. Offering

                    of information is essential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first step to good communication is to ask, “How can I help?”</p>

                <p>If you know a customer is hard-of-hearing, or if you work in a noisy
                    environment, you can attract their attention with a welcoming comment, or a
                    wave.</p>
                <p>Do not shout. If possible, move to a well-lit area away from a window or move
                    to a quieter space. Speak slowly and clearly.
                </p>
                <p>You may also ask if an alternative form of communication would be helpful. Other options include
                    using a pen and paper, or using a cell phone to text.</p>
                <p>Confirm whether you have been understood and offer to repeat information.</p>
                <p>If your client is deaf, you may wish to organize professional interpretation,
                    if necessary.</p>

                <!-- Section 2's content -->
                <br>
                <p>Do not assume that only people with white canes have low or no vision. This is especially important,
                    if you work in an environment with low lighting, such as a restaurant. </v>

                    <p>Identify yourself as you approach and speak directly to the customer.</p>

                    <p>If a customer requests guidance, offer your elbow or shoulder. Relax and walk at a normal pace.
                        Advise the person about any obstacles, such as a pillar.</p>

                    <p>Ensure that everyone can access your print or electronic messages.</p>

                    <p>If a customer requests assistance with reading or instructions, speak clearly and away from other
                        noises.</p>

                    <p>For print communications, use an easy-to-read, non-Serif font in 12-point size. Use colour
                        contrast
                        (black on white or blue on yellow) and lots of white space. Avoid italics and bold.</p>

                    <p>Keep a master document of printed materials, in order to produce a larger print version upon
                        customer
                        request.</p>

                    <p>Include a text description of images and charts. Many people who are blind use screen reader
                        software
                        to access print electronically.</p>

                    <p>Labels are generally too small to read. Consider having a magnifying glass readily available on
                        site.
                    </p>

                    <p>Include a notice and contact information on brochures and other documents that inform the public
                        “Information is available in other formats, upon request.”</p>

                <p>
                    A stroke, injury, or other disability may affect a customer’s speech. Protective
                    barriers that separate a service provider from a customer, and wearing a
                    personal protective mask can also muffle speech.
                </p>
                <p>Find a quiet place to communicate. Do not make assumptions about what a person may understand or
                    remember.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are unsure of what was said, repeat the information to confirm, or
                    politely ask the customer to repeat the information. Do not interrupt or finish
                    your customer’s sentences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If possible, ask questions that can be answered with a “yes” or “no” response,
                    or consider using a pen and paper, or text messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When communicating by phone, let the customer know that you are having
                    difficulty with understanding. Ask if there may be another way to communicate.
                    Do not hang up!

                <p>Brain injury, learning and intellectual disabilities, dementia, and mental illness can all affect
                    understanding and memory. A stressful, busy environment, such as a mall (especially during holidays)
                    can have the same outcome. </p>
                <p>Do not make assumptions about what a person may understand or remember.</p>
                <p>Use plain, easy to understand language, and incorporate pictures with descriptions in print
                    materials, signage, and web content.</p>
                <p>Make written information clear and simple.</p>
                <p>Offer precise directions. Providing one piece of information at a time may be helpful.</p>
                <p>Invite clients to bring a support person to take notes during a meeting.</p>
                <p>To help with wayfinding, use simple signage in key traffic areas, and ensure signage does not create
                    a physical barrier.</p>
                <p>If a customer appears to be anxious or in crisis, ask them to tell you the
                    best way to help. Be confident, calm, and reassuring.</p>
