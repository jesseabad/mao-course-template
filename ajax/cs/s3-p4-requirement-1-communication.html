            <p>Requirement one states that organizations and their employees must
                communicate in a way that best meets the needs of their customers.
            </p>

            <h2 class="clear-both">What can you do to meet this requirement?</h2>
            <p class="">We all have different communication needs. The key to meeting this
                requirement is understanding what your customers’ needs are and doing your best
                to meet them.</p>
            <ol class="">
                <li>Treat all customers with respect. A friendly smile is a great start.</li>
                <li>Give customers the opportunity to tell you what they need, including how
                    they wish to communicate.</li>
                <li>Speak directly to the person and maintain eye contact, rather than speaking
                    to a companion, aide or an interpreter.</li>
                <li>Print documents in clear, easy-to-read fonts, with lots of colour contrast,
                    including menus, forms and signs.</li>
            </ol>
