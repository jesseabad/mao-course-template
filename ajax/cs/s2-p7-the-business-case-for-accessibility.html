    <h1>The Business Case for Accessibility</h1><br>
    <p><strong>Creating Accessibility is the Law in Manitoba.</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>For Manitoba businesses, removing barriers is also the smart thing to do.</strong></p>
    <p>Currently, millions of Canadians have a physical disability that affects
        their mobility, vision, or hearing. This number is expected to increase substantially
        by 2030, when persons with physical disabilities are anticipated to make up
        over one fifth of the consumer market, with a spending power of $316 billion.
        Removing barriers to access often costs little or nothing.</p>

They do business, shop and travel with their friends and families in our communities, just like everyone else. Learning how to eliminate barriers may attract customer loyalty and improve service for everyone. Source: Ontario Chamber of Commerce, 2017."
