    <h1>Focus on Barriers, Not Disabilities</h1>

                <p>For people with disabilities, a barrier is anything that interacts with their
                    disability in a way that may impact, or even prevent their full and effective
                    participation in society.</p>
                <p>
                    Creating accessibility is about removing barriers and supporting people’s
                    participation in society.</p>
                <p>
                    What does this mean for you?</p>
                <p>
                    It means that creating accessibility starts with understanding what barriers
                    exist in your organization that may prevent customers from accessing goods or
                    services.</p>
