            <p>Narrator: Accessibility is good for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narrator: So what does accessibility mean for you?
            </p>
            <p>
                John Wyndels: It means going to the places I want to go to. It means if I want
                to go to a restaurant, if I want to buy a pair of pants, whatever the case may
                be, it means I have the ability to go there and get what I’m looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either through a traditional front door method, or if I have to, make other
                arrangements.
            </p>
            <p>
                But them being receptive to the fact that, because I’m in a wheelchair I still
                want whatever they’re selling or giving.
