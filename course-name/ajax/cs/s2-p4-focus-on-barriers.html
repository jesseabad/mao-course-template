    <h1>Focus on Barriers</h1>
    <p>The AMA focuses on barriers, not

                <h2 class="media-heading">What is a barrier?</h2>
                <p>
                    For people with disabilities, a
                    <a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="barriers">barrier</a>
                    is anything that interacts with their disability in a way that may impact, or
                    prevent their full and effective participation in society.</p>
                <p>For example, Mike has low vision. He is given a book with a font size that he
                    cannot read. Mike’s low vision is not the barrier. The small print size is the
                    barrier. If Mike had larger print, he would be able to read the material.</p>
                <p>While most barriers have not been set up on purpose, awareness is critical to
                    ensure everyone has equal access to goods and services.</p>

                    <p>
                        If you are like most people, you may be thinking of physical or structural
                        barriers, such as steps, curbs, or narrow passageways. Heavy doors or doorknobs,
                        versus levers, are also structural barriers that affect many seniors and others
                        with arthritis.</p>

                <h3 class="media-heading">Information and Communications Barriers</h3>
                <p>Barriers to information and communications are easy to miss, if they do not
                    affect you, but are present in almost every aspect of daily life.</p>
                <p>Barriers to information and communications occur when not everyone can
                    understand or access the message being delivered.</p>
                <p>For example, in-person communication may be difficult when a location is
                    noisy and if a person is hard-of-hearing, or anxious.</p>

                <h3 class="media-heading">Technology Barriers
                </h3>

                <p>Technology can enhance access. For example, a computer can improve
                    accessibility for someone who is deaf or hard-of-hearing. However, technology can also create new
                    barriers. For instance, a barrier is created when an individual must have good vision or use of
                    their fingers to use a device to pay a bill.</p>

                <h3 class="media-heading">Systemic Barriers
                </h3>
                <p>Barriers are systemic when they are a result of an organization’s policies or
                    usual practices. For example, a store policy that requires that customers bag
                    their own groceries is a systemic barrier, as not all customers are physically
                    able to do so.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 class="media-heading">Attitudinal Barriers
                </h3>
                <p>Attitudinal barriers result when people think and act based on false
                    assumptions. For example, a bank teller would be wrong to think a client who is
                    unable to express herself verbally cannot make a financial decision. Breaking
                    myths and stereotypes is the first step to creating the foundation of a fully
                    inclusive society.</p>

    </ul>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h4>Did you know?</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Attitudes</strong>
            are the greatest barrier of all. With the right attitude, most barriers can be
            avoided.</p>

        <li class="dfn-disability-people-with-disabilities">A disability is a condition that limits a person’s
            daily activities. People with disabilities may have long-term physical, mental,
            intellectual or sensory impairments, which, in interaction with various
            barriers, may hinder their participation on an equal basis with others.
            <br><br>A disability, aging, an injury and other life events may temporarily or
            permanently affect:
            <ul>
                <li>mobility</li>
                <li>dexterity (use of hands)</li>
                <li>vision</li>
                <li>hearing</li>
                <li>communication</li>

                <li>mental health</li>
            </ul>
        </li>



        <li class="dfn-barriers">Barriers are obstacles that limit access and prevent
            people with disabilities from fully participating in everyday life. Most
            barriers are not intentional. Barriers usually arise because spaces, goods or
            services do not take into account users’ diversity of abilities. For instance,
            this might be related to height, strength, memory or understanding. For more
