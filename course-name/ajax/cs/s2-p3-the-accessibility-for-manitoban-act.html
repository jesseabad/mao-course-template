				<h2 class="media-heading">The Five Accessibility Standards </h2>
				<p> Accessibility Standards, or regulations, are the building blocks of the AMA. They outline who has to
					do what and by when to enhance accessibility.
					<p>To fulfill the AMA, the Manitoba government appointed an Accessibility Advisory Council to assist
						in developing five standards affecting accessibility in customer service, employment,
						information and communications, the design of public spaces and transportation.</p><br>
