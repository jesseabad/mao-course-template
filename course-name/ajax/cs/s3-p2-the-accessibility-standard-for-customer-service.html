                <p>The Accessibility Standard for Customer Service requires all of us to put the
                    customer first.</p>
                <p>
                    “Customer” means anyone who benefits from an organization’s goods or services,
                    including non-paying learners, patients, organizational members and
                    participants. The Accessibility Standard for Customer Service requires
                    organizations to provide flexible customer-centred service by identifying,
                    removing, and preventing barriers.</p>
                <p>If a barrier cannot be removed, the organization should provide alternative
                    options, up to the point of undue hardship.</p>
