    <h1>Requirement 7: Welcome Feedback</h1>
    <ul class="media-list">

                <p>Requirement seven states that organizations and their employees must welcome feedback on the
                    accessibility of an organization’s goods and services and document the resulting actions.
                    Organizations must share this information with members of the public, upon request.</p>
                <h2 class="clear-both">What can you do to meet this requirement?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ask customers with disabilities about their experience(s) and use the feedback to learn how to
                        meet the accessibility needs of the people you serve.</li>
                    <li>Allow customers to provide feedback in various ways. For example, online feedback forms may work
                        for some customers, but others may prefer to speak to someone.
                    </li>
                    <li>Respond to customers’ requests in a reasonable timeframe. For instance, confirm you have
                        received the customers’ feedback and tell them when they can expect a response.</li>
                    <li>Inform all employees about your organization’s feedback process, and integrate accessibility
                        feedback into a broader feedback policy.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="alert alert-success">
                <h3>Important Reminder</h3>
                <p>What works for one person, may not work for another. People have different communication needs, so
                    allow customers to provide feedback in different ways.</p>
            </div>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
