	<h1>Key Features</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the Accessible Customer Service learning module. Before you continue, please review the following
		information about the key module features.</p>
	<h2>Navigation</h2>
	<p>This module is organized into five sections and includes a glossary of terms. You can navigate through this
		module by using the Previous and Next links at the bottom of each page, or the main menu on the left side of the
		page.</p>
	<p>The main menu is organized into module sections. When you select a section title, the menu will expand to show
		all content in that section. Selecting a different title will open new content. You can use the main menu to
		move freely between module sections.</p>
	<p>To help you track your progress, a green checkmark will appear in the menu beside each page that you have
		visited. </p>
	<p>If you have any technical or access issues, please visit the contact page on our website.</p>

	<h2>Knowledge Checks </h2>
	<p>Sections two, three, and four of this module end with a Knowledge Check to help you check your understanding of
		the material.</p>
	<p>When you complete all four Knowledge Checks, you will receive a certificate of completion.</p>

	<p> This module includes a glossary of terms. To open the glossary, go to the upper right corner of this page and
		select the Glossary link. The glossary will open on the right side of the page. You can scroll or tab through
		the terms.</p>
	<h2>Audio</h2>
	<p>Each page offers you the option to listen to the contents of the page. To play the audio, navigate to the upper
		right corner of the page and click the Listen button. You can use the forward and backward buttons to control
