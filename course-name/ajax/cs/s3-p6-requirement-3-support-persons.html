    <p>Requirement three states that organizations and their employees must welcome
        support persons who are assisting customers and allow them to remain together.
        If you need to charge admission for the support person, provide advance notice.
    </p>
    <h2 class="clear-both">What is a support person?
    </h2>
    <p>A
        <a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="support-person">support person</a>
        assists with mobility, personal care, medical needs or with specific tasks like
        banking. A support person can be a paid personal support worker (PSW), a
        volunteer, a family member, or a friend. PSWs are trained professionals. Family
        or friends usually do not have formal training, but they often have years of
        experience. Many people have paid and unpaid support. For instance, a person may
        have a PSW present at their workplace and then go out in the evening with their
        partner acting as a support person.</p>
    <h2>What can you do to meet this requirement?
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Speak directly to your customer or service recipient and do not assume they
            cannot understand. Most people prefer to make their own decisions about what to
            buy or how a service may affect them.
        </li>
        <li>If the nature of your conversation or service is private, ask your client
            whether to include the support person. Check with your client on whether he/she
            prefers to discuss a decision first with the support person.</li>
        <li>Invite the support person to take notes if this is helpful for your client’s
            understanding of important information or instructions, for instance, at medical
            appointments.</li>
        <li>Avoid charging entrance admission or other fees for a support person, if
            possible.</li>
        <li>The standard requires that, if you need to charge admission for the support
            person, provide advance notice, for example, by advertising this charge on your
            website or entrance fee billboard.
        </li>
    </ol>
