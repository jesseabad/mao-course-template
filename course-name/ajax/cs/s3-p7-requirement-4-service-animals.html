                <p>Requirement four states that organizations and their employees must allow service animals in the
                    public areas of the premises.</p>

                <h2 class="clear-both">What is a service animal?</h2>
                <p><a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="service-animals">Service animals</a> are working animals that
                    are trained to meet the needs of their handlers with a disability.</p>
                <h2>How do you know if an animal is a service animal?</h2>
                <p>A service animal might wear a harness or vest. Many, but not all handlers carry documentation, such
                    as a letter from a health professional or service animal trainer, which states that they require the
                    animal because of a disability-related need.</p>

                <h3>Important Reminder</h3>
                <p>A handler need not disclose a diagnosis or personal health information.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Focus on your customer. A service animal should not be touched or distracted.</li>
                    <li>The service animal must be under control at all times. If the customer is not controlling the
                        service animal, you may offer a warning and eventually ask them to leave.</li>
                    <li>Consider including the statement “service animals are welcome, but pets are not allowed” in your
                        registration information, event details, or business/organization information. The Manitoba
                        Accessibility Office can provide you with an image for individual use, and/or an adhesive decal
                        for windows (see below). This message also alerts people with allergies to come up with
                        solutions, if necessary, in advance of arrival.

                    <li class="nopad">Not sure if an animal is a service animal? Here are some tips:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can ask: “Has this animal been trained to help with a disability-related need?</li>
                            <li>Consider asking for documentation only when it is not obvious that the animal is
                                providing a service.</li>
                        </ul>

        <li class="dfn-service-animals">Defined by The Human Rights Code (Manitoba), a service animal is trained to
            assist a person with a disability. The work or tasks a service animal performs must be directly related to a
            person’s physical or mental disability. Animals that provide comfort and companionship, but are not trained
            to assist with a person’s disability, are not service animals. For more information on service animals,
            please visit the Manitoba Human Rights Commission.</li>
